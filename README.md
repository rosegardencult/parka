Parka
=======

Introduction
------------

[Duktape](http://duktape.org/) is an **embeddable Javascript** engine,
with a focus on **portability** and **compact** footprint.

Parka is a rewrite of Duktape (version 2.5, git hash [600188](https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/tree/6001888049cb42656f8649db020e804bcdeca6a7)) in Rust.

My goal is to use various methods of rewriting C into Rust ([carols10cents'](https://github.com/carols10cents/rust-out-your-c-talk) rust out your c method, Citrus, C2Rust, etc.)

Development Tools
------------

The makefile references bear, cloc, and clang, as well as cargo and the gnu utils, which will have to be installed separately to enable using their corresponding make targets.
